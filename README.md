# mapkc

 A summer enrichment program for youth in Kansas City to map assets in their communities and contribute to a central database, 
 which will be available for all to use.
 
# stakeholder
* People who need mental health resources in Kansas City. 
* Doctors who recommend resources to patients.
* Mental health resource centers looking to serve the community.

# problem_statement
Mental health patients  are often not aware of the resources available to them and  doctors might not have a full list of references to give to a person. This project hopes to be two-fold : find and collect data, information, location on all relevant mental health services (from psychotherapists to support groups) and then catalog and update that information in an easily accessible database or map.

# minimum_viable_solution
Web based application that matches mental health resources to patients based on a number of factors such as proximity,

# additional_opportunity
There is additional opportunity to expand this resource past mental health, into physical health, social work, etc.
